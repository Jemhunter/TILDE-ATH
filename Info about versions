To explain how I am handling versions in the edits I make to this forked version.

The main file of the fork contains Drocta ~ATH version of the interpreter.

The file Interactive version contains my edited version which works as an extension to the main version to add a different kind of
functionality on top of the original (not necessarily better just different) but still functions the same and all programs written for
the main version will still work. Two versions for both python 2 and 3 (I cannot always guarantee python 2 version will work flawlessly as
I primarily work in pyhton 3.)
